# Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?): #

### Megan: ###

    * like to be comfortable with all the processes that we are using. (not just putting them in without a clear understanding of their meaning)*

### George: ###

    * grow my understanding of how to write more concise methods and how the project process works more completely*

### As a team, we want to: ###

    * pass: the assignment, but more importantly learn how to learn and grow as a team*

### How will we know that we are successful?: ###

    Megan:
      * we pass!
    George:
      * We will have gone through some challenges (tearing of the muscle) and can explain the growth that comes with additional practice



## Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):

### How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles: ###

  Megan:

  George:
    Tanacity, Active Listener, Problem solving, Researcher

### Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section): ###

  * Together: work daily on this project, from about 4:30 to early-ish evening. Taking Pomo breaks. Work hard in the time that we are working. Wrap up each session with actionable next steps for us both to work on

### Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?): ###

  * Together:
      * continually check in to access more or less time needed on the project. Daily. Mainly using Zoom and Slack
      * use the pros/cons approach. Talk about it. Listen to each other
      * we both have the tendency to shutdown when overwhelmed. So...
        * Megan needs some direct badgering, with overt actions
        * George needs more gentle nudging with words of "we got this"

### Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement): ###

  Megan:
    strengths:
      * maneuver through zoom. getting more comfortable with pull request. using terminal commands. can use atom as a text editor. use git commands
    work on:
      * complete understanding of what the code is doing. More fluidity. Not stopping as often to think about simple things.
  George:
    strengths:
      * organizational understanding of the job at hand. using gitflow(mostly). not blowing things off.
    work on:
      * more concise method writing. using only attr_readers when necessary. following the guidelines of the IP. learning how to work in a paired project at Turing. less use of `if-statements`. logic soundness

### Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?): ###

  Together:
    * we will be working this in the driver/navigator style of co-working through the first iteration, with the expectation that we will we visit that technique as we move on to the next iteration
  Megan:
  George:


### Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques): ###

  Megan: zoom and GitHub
  George:
    * working on our own branches, so when we push we push to main.
    * work with GitHub Projects
    * ability to use Repl


### Pomodoro Break Schedule: ###

  Together:
    * Every 25 minutes: 5 minute break
    * Every 5th break is a 15 minute break.


### Expectations for giving and receiving feedback: ###

  Megan:
    * a little bit of blunt feedback, but can handle a lot if it's gentle. As far as, answering questions that arise, guidence to the answer allows for growth, unless it's a whit's end situation
  George:
    * prefers gentle approach, can handle a lot. As far as, answering the questions that arise, guidence to the answer allows for growth, unless it's a whit's end situation
